h1. IP Whitelist Middleware

h2. About

Rack Middleware for websites that need to contain access to a group of ip addresses (a whitelist).
Outside these addresses, vistors are shown 403 Forbidden page.
The whitelist is maintained via environment-specific lists in a YAML configuration file.

h3. Usage

h4. Rails 3

in Gemfile

@gem 'ip_whitelist', :git => 'git://github.com/nexiahome/ip_whitelist.git'@

That's it! _(Railtie will auto-load this middleware code right after Rails::Logger)_

Use @'rake middleware'@ to see the load order

h3. YAML File

Be sure to set up your YAML file to list the whitelisted IPs. It must be at:

@config/whitelist.yml@

Otherwise it will not be loaded.

h3. Kudos

This middleware gem started from *https://github.com/jake3030/rack-ip-whitelist* but changed enough to warrant it's own new name.
